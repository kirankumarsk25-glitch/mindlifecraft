1- RESEACH & DEVELOPMENT  
HEALING FOR TODAY & FUTURE EPIDEMICS  
 At Mind life craft, we don’t just sell medicines we craft them for you. Just as 
the ancient Vaidya  would handpick each Dravya , prepare it with precision, 
and tailor it to the patient’s unique needs, we begin with a personal 
consultation, source pristine raw materials, and create remedies designed 
exclusively for your body’s requirements. Our medicines  go beyond 
removing disease, they awaken balance, vitality, and complete wellness, so 
you leave not just healed, but  truly  renewed . 
 Our journey begins exactly where Ayurveda placed its foundations -
understanding your prakriti , lifestyle  and rhythms, metabolic strength, and 
the hidden patterns behind your imbalance. Then, we take Ayurveda  
forward for the healing touch  
 At MindLifeCraft, every formulation begins with a deep scientific 
understanding of the drug’s journey within the body . We design novel 
therapeutics by meticulously analysing the  pharmacokinetics - absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)  along with the 
bioavailability  and molecular behaviour of each compound.  
 By mapping how actives interact with metabolic pathways, cellular 
receptors, and biochemical dysfunction , we craft products that are not only 
effective but also precision  targeted for metabolic restoration and disease 
correction  
 We aim at transforming classical herbs into new drug delivery system 
approaches like - 
♠ Nanoparticle based formulations  for deeper cellular reach  
♠ Liposomal & targeted drug carriers  to enhance permeability  
♠ Bioavailability boosted herb combinations  rooted in classical 
wisdom  
♠ Novel dosage forms  for faster and more predictable results  
 Altered  lifestyles result in  diseases  like Diabetes, PCOS, Dyslipidaemia, 
NAFLD, Other Metabolic d ysfunctions , Cancer etc  
Challenges where conventional care alone often falls short , our solutions go deeper  by n ot just suppressing symptoms  but rewriting the internal 
environment by treating the root cause  so disease has no place to manifest  
 By revers ing metabolic dysfunctions , restor ing hormonal imbalances, 
combating  oxidative & inflammatory stress , strengthen ing immunity -
This is Ayurveda  not only preserved, but evolved .

4-SHALYA TANTRA :  
THE WORLD’S EARLIEST AUTHORITY IN ANORECTAL SURGERY  
♠ Long before Hippocrates took to the surgical field  & centuries before 
Celsus or Galen documented their techniques , a man performed complex  
surgical  procedures in ancient India , by with medieval instruments that he 
himself manufactured. For his contributions, Acharya  Sushruta  has been 
aptly named ‘the Father of Plastic Surgery’ and ‘the Hippocrates’ of the 
sixth or seventh century BC.  ♠ With precision  crafted instruments and unmatched clinical insight, he 
detailed the diagnosis and treatment of bhagandara  (fistula),  arshas  
(haemorrhoids ), parikartika  (fissure), vidradhi  (abscess)  nadi vrana  
(sinus  tracts ), siraja granthi  (varicose veins & ulcers) , dustha vranas  etc 
with a sophistication that the world would not rediscover for millennia.  
♠ His pioneering methods  kshara k arma, agni karma, raktamokshana and 
the revolutionary kshara sutra therapy remain global gold standards today 
for their minimal recurrence, remarkable safety, and unparalleled 
functional outcomes.  
♠ Mind lifecraft stands as living proof that India’s ancient surgical science is 
not a relic of history, but a clinically superior  outcome  driven solution for 
today.
